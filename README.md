# Xmas Card

This project demo's an arduino leonardo micro pro, that plugs into a computer and opens up the terminal/command prompt when either the mac/windows button has been pressed.

When terminal/command prompt is open, it makes your computer speak to you (if on mac), displays ascii art text and then opens a web browser url. The url contains a playable game that is controlled by the arrow keys, which are inputted via the arduino when the buttons on the controller are pressed.
