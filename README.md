# Code-School--AJAX

These files demonstrate (in its most basic form) how one can use AJAX to dynamically pull live information from an API – in this case, Last.FM! Useful when you’re working with interactive social media apps/installations ;)

What this does:

This project demonstrates an AJAX call to the Last.fm api, that then sends back data about an artist: Cher (born Cherilyn Sarkisian).

Once the page receives the data about Cher, it then does a second callback – searching for similar artists and displays them on the page.

It then finishes off with one final callback finding each artists most popular albums and displaying them under each artist.

How to get it to work:

Download each file to your computer.
Upload via FTP to your web server.
Open up the index.html on your server and see it working!
Next steps to advance in AJAX:

Set up a searchbox that can search last.fm's artist database.
Since this has all been set up dynamically, this project should show different artists and their best albums – depending on what you search for!
