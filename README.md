# Twilio - Node - Data Mcfly - AJAX - ResponsiveVoiceJS

These files demonstrate how one can use Twilio to receive sms from phones, process that data in a javascript back end and then make it speak in the front end.

What this does (https://www.instagram.com/p/-CgVXNyiAH/):

This project demonstrates a text being sent from my mobile, to a sample number that is set up on Twilio.

Once the text has been received by the sample number, it then forwards that data onto the NodeJS back end of my website.

It is then processed in Data Mcfly and forwarded onto the front end via an AJAX call, which is then spoken by ResponsiveVoiceJS

How to get it to work:

I HAVE NOT INCLUDED ANY FILES FROM "node_modules" in this repository, follow this tutorial, to get all dependancies installed correctly:
