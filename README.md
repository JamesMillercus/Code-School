These files demonstrate how one can use Facebook.api and AJAX to dynamically pull live information from an Last.FM's API.

What this does:

This project demonstrates a facebook login request, that pulls the users Facebook Likes, profile photo and cover photos.

Once the page receives the data about the users Facebook likes, it then loops through each like and makes an AJAX call to Last.FM's API - to find music artist's that relate to each of them. 

The final result is a page full of your photos, likes and potential artists on the Last.FM's api, that you may be interested in - all with links to view their music. 

How to get it to work:

Download each file to your computer. Upload via FTP to your web server (or use a local server like MAMP). Open up the index.html on your server, log into your Facebook account and see it working!
